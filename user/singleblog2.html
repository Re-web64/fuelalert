<p id="text">Following the hardship due to fuel subsidy removal, the son of the general overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, Leke Adeboye, has donated fuel to some worshippers in the church.
Adeboye, who is also the lead pastor at the RCCG, LSC The Bridge in Ikeja, Lagos, made the donation on Sunday.

According to a statement on Tuesday, the move was to assist the worshippers amid the hike in the price of premium motor spirit.

The statement read, “It was an unusual church service on Sunday for many members of the LSC The Bridge: one of the RCCG’s vibrant youth churches led by Pastor Leke Adeboye.

“With the fuel price hike and cost of living crisis hitting hard on many Nigerians, Pastor Leke and the head of Christian Social Responsibility for the RCCG Youth Province 1, Lagos State, came up with a brilliant initiative to support church members.

“Over 1,000 litres of fuel were contributed to support anyone who came to church on Sunday with their vehicle.”

The move was also described as a way of empowering young people and taxi drivers who used their cars for businesses and relied on them for their daily upkeep and expenses.

“They all drove in their cars and had their tanks filled with petroleum or diesel. In addition to this, over 500 people also had their bodies fuelled with good food.

“It was an essential Christian social responsibility move needed for such a time as this,” the statement added.

After the programme, the pastor said: “You cannot use God’s fuel to do illegal things, use the fuel wisely.”</p>
