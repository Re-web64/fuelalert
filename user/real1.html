  <h2>Introduction to Fuel and Fuel Efficiency</h2>
    <div class = "write-up">
    	<h3>Meaning of Fuel?</h3>
     <p>Fuel is a substance that is burned to provide nuclear energy, heat or power. Materials like coal, wood, oil, or gas can provide heat when burned. Methanol, Gasoline, Diesel, Propane, Natural gas, Hydrogen are types of fuel. Nuclear energy is produced by burning plutonium. From fuel efficiency or fuel economy, we can measure how long any vehicle could travel, which is the opposite of fuel consumption. Fuel consumption is the amount of fuel vehicle uses to travel a particular distance. Fuel efficiency is measured in kilometers per liter. The efficiency with which the fuel does a conversion of energy is known as fuel efficiency. Let us understand the definition of Fuel, Fuel Efficiency, and Types of Fuel in greater detail.</p>


     <h3>Examples of fuel</h3>
     <img src="asset/types.jpg" id="mockup1"></img>
<p>Methanol.
Gasoline.
Diesel.
Natural gas.
Hydrogen.
Biodiesel.</p>

<h3>Types of fuel</h3>
     <img src="asset/type.jpg" id="mockup1"></img>

<p>Solid Fuel
Liquid Fuel
Fuel Gas
Biofuel
Fossil Fuel</p>

<h3>Fuel Efficiency</h3>
     <img src="asset/efficiency.jpg" id="mockup1"></img>
<p>Now you know that energy cannot be created or destroyed, All energy can only be transferred. Fuel also do not create energy. They only convert the chemical energy of the fuel to the kinetic energy with the help of the thermal energy supplied to them. The efficiency with which the fuel does this conversion of energy is known as fuel efficiency.</p>
