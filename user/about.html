          	        <p><sup>FUEL ALERT</sup> is a fuel monitoring App designed by a group of strong willed individuals brought together by OLUAKA Institute of Technology Internship called ODP Cohort9 which centered more on Front End Web Development Programme. Their aim of developing this App is to help monitor the prices of fuel in different fuel stations across Imo State. With this, Individuals will be able to know the fuel prices sold by different fuel stations within and far away from their location from the comfort of their homes. <sup>This</sup> will also reduce the rate of fuel hike as individuals will tend to patronize those that sell at lower rate more than those with higher rate thereby enabling those with high prices to regulate their price rate. We at ODP Cohort9 as a team of Developers are glad to be part of this project that will ease off stress on user's of fuel.</p>
