     <h2>How to Know When an Engine is About to Die</h2>
     <p>Your engine has several systems that must operate in tandem. Obviously, some components provide drivetrain propulsion, some allow you to steer and some assist in stopping your car. Because of today’s ECU-controlled cars (Electronic Control Unit), it’s possible that when even one system has a problem, your engine may shut itself down to prevent further damage to the vehicle as a whole. Ignoring such an incident could lead to your motor sustaining permanent damage and reaching the end of its life sooner than you ever expected.</p>

<p>When driving, don’t blast music the entire time, as much as you want to. You need to get to know the sound of your vehicle’s engine so you can tell if something is off, especially if your vehicle is getting older. The sounds you hear from under the hood could indicate an impending problem. Pay attention for sounds you typically don’t hear, such as:
<br>
<br>
<span id="Bold">Knocking:</span> Engine knocking often comes from improper timing. A knocking at high revs, also called pinging, may originate from bad spark plugs or poor-quality gasoline. A knock that starts at low revs and worsens as your engine spins faster could come from a worn bearing in the motor, which can require rebuilding the entire engine. Here, a proven fuel system treatment/additive might be all you need.
<br>
<br>
<span id="Bold">Tapping:</span>Tapping noises may indicate premature fuel burning. Left unchecked, this situation could severely damage the pistons, requiring expensive repairs.
<br>
<br>
<span id="Bold">Grinding</span>: Grinding noises indicate metal is rubbing against a surface. Typically lubrication or design prevents grinding from happening in cars, so when you hear it, you know there’s a problem. Exactly when the grinding occurs will help you diagnose the cause. For instance, grinding when turning the key in the ignition could be caused by a worn-out starter that needs changing. If the noise occurs when your vehicle shifts gears, you may need a new transmission. Grinding when you hit the brakes could mean you need to replace the brake rotors and pads.
Don’t let unusual noises go unnoticed, especially if your car is older and might be due for some maintenance. Take a little time whenever you get behind the wheel to listen to your engine while you drive. Doing so can help you identify when your engine sends a warning sound that it requires attention.</p>


<h3>Loss of Power</h3>

<p>A sudden drop in power while driving is the precursor to stalling and more serious engine damage. Your vehicle may stop or slow. When power comes back, it could jerk back into motion roughly and abruptly. This extra movement may cause you to lose control on the highway or if you are driving in wet or snowy conditions, or are navigating tricky off-road trails. And the cause of the problem may be more mundane than you think.

Many problems cause a sudden loss of power. Most notable, clogged fuel lines or subpar fluids can prevent your engine from running smoothly. Dirty fuel can clog fuel injectors, which fail to send adequate gasoline into each cylinder. A badly clogged air filter can reduce the amount of fresh air reaching the engine, just as a dirty oil filter affects engine oil flow and performance. To get back on the road, you will need to carefully evaluate your entire engine and its fluids. Changing the fluids and filters and using quality fuel system additives to prevent future damage may help restore your vehicle’s driving capabilities.</p>

<h2>Engine Continues Running With the Ignition Off</h2>
<img src="asset/engine1.jpg." id="mockup1"></img>
<p>When you shut off the ignition, the motor should also turn off immediately. If the motor continues to run, even for a short time, after you remove the key, you have a problem that requires addressing before the engine fails.

Dieseling is the most common reason your engine may continue to run, and you don’t have to have a diesel engine for this to happen. In a gasoline-fueled engine, turning off the motor should stop the spark plugs from igniting fuel in the cylinders. When the engine has enough residual heat to light the gasoline, it’s a condition called dieseling because the action mimics the operation of a diesel engine, which does not use spark plugs. Today’s fuel-injected engines rarely have this problem, but vintage automobiles equipped with carburetors may experience it.

To fix dieseling temporarily, switch to a higher-octane fuel or use a fuel additive to reduce carbon deposits. Changing the spark plugs may also help the issue for a while. Over time, however, you will still need to take your vehicle to a mechanic for more extensive repairs.</p>
