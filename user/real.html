     <h2>Motorists lose engines, pay more for repairs over dirty fuel purchase </h2>
     <p>Motorists whose vehicles were affected by adulterated fuel imported by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, need to get new engines or incur higher costs to maintain the performance of their vehicles.
Depending on the level of damage to their vehicles, some are being advised to replace the engines, if they hope to get value for their money or spend an average of N100,000 to replace certain parts without guarantee of efficient output.
Some auto technicians who spoke to The Guardian said that motorists might end up spending about N100,000 to N150,000 depending on the brand of vehicles involved to fix the mess.
The technicians said dirty fuel in circulation affect everyone and it depends on the degrees of damages that the bad fuel has caused.</p>
