<p id="text">President Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has said that apart from international pricing, extortion by security agencies like the Department of State Security (DSS), Police and arbitrary levies by government agencies are responsible for the recent increase in fuel price from N537 to N617.

The National President of the association, Mr Chinedu Okoronkwo made the accusation at a public hearing organised by the House of Representatives Ad hoc Committee on the Recent Hike in Petrol Pump Price on Tuesday.

According to him, Nigeria is now under the regime of the Petroleum Industry Act adding that what controls the market now is reality.
<br>
<br>
Okoronkwo disclosed that IPMAN members are presently cash trapped and cannot engage in direct importation of fuel as they are presently owed about N250 billion by Nigeria ‘s oil giant, the NNPCL.

He further called on the government to instruct all it’s agencies to put a stop to arbitrary charges which are built into the price of fuel by marketers.

Speaking on the way forward on the present challenges in the oil sector, the President however recommended a switch to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) to permanently address the rising cost of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) in the country in order to ease challenges faced due to the removal of subsidy.
<br>
<br>
Okoronkwo acknowledged that the only way for Nigeria to make meaningful progress was to remove fuel subsidy so that government can save money for other critical aspect of the economy.
<br>
<br>
He explained that in a deregulated business, the reality and the fundamentals of the business will play out as everyone has seen in the increase of petrol petrol price sequel to the removal of fuel subsidy.
