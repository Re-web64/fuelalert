<p id="text">Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has caused a stir online with his exotic collection of a Patek Philippe wristwatch estimated to sell for N160 million.
This comes amidst the poverty and soaring inflation biting hard on many residents of Lagos and other part of Nigeria due to the fuel subsidy removal.
The luxury watch was shared online by social commentator Feyi Fawehinmi on Sunday afternoon alongside the watch’s price on the Chrono24 website, a platform where the wealthiest people in the world shop for their wrist candies.
Chrono 24, on its website, pegged the wristwatch’s price at £136,189, about N160 million, based on the current exchange rate of N1,170 per pound.
